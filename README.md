# Correlations between programming languages and beliefs about programming

## Methods

- We designed a survey to assess whether people who know different
  programming languages feel differently about the programming.
- The survey was administered first at an Association for Computing
  Machinery (ACM) sponsored conference and later on social media.
- For more details about the methods, including on how to work on this project
  or reproduce results, see the [methods.md](methods.md).

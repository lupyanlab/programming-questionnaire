# Beliefs about programming

## Methods

We designed a survey to assess whether people who know different programming
languages feel differently about programming. The survey was administered first
at an Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) conference and later
distributed on social media. For more details about the methods, including how
to work on this project or reproduce results, see the
[Methods](docs/methods.md) document.

**Data privacy.** Raw survey data is not stored in this repo. The results of the
survey are presented in aggregate form as figures and statistics.

**Open science.** The code used to analyze the data is included in this repo.
All results can be reproduced by cloning this repo and compiling the Rmarkdown
documents. To reproduce our results, access can be granted to an anonymized
version of the data upon request.

## Results

The results of the survey are presented in the following
reports and interactive documents.

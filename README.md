# Correlations between programming languages and beliefs about programming

## Methods

We designed a survey to assess whether people who know different programming
languages feel differently about programming. The survey was administered first
at an Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) sponsored conference and later
distributed on social media. For more details about the methods, including on
how to work on this project or reproduce results, see
[Methods](docs/methods.md).

## Reports

The results of the survey are presented in the following
reports.

1. [Programming languages](docs/languages.md)
:   What programming languages are represented in the survey?

2. [Beliefs about programming](docs/beliefs.md)
:   Correlations between languages and beliefs about programming.
